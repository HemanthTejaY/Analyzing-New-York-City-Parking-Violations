Some of the data quality issues that we have are:-

1. MISSING DATA - Incomeplete data

Some of the data in the given datasets is missing. There are many parts of the data where there is missing variables
For example , in parking-violations.csv
For summons number = 1378308797 --> We dont have a vehicle body type 
That is, the field is empty and the value for this particular variable is missing. 

2. INCONSISTENT DATA 

The next problem we faced in parking-violations.csv is that the data is consistent. We deduce this because of the following :-
-->We have a varible named intersection street in the data set. Most of the summon number's dont have intersection streets. This not only leads to the problem of incomplete data., but also makes the variable pointless --> because most of the summon number's dont have corresponding dta of intersection street - making the consistent useage of this variable for deducing useful insights pointless.

3. MEMORY WASTEAGE

In the given dataset, parking-violations.csv , we have a coloumn called law section
And all the vehicles registered for the parking violation, violate law section 408. But since this applies to every vehicle and is common across the entire dataset, we would not require this variable as it wont really help us deduce any useful insights as we can assume that every vehicle that is booked for parking violations, is registered under law violation - section 408. 

4. INCORRECT DATA - LACK OF CONSISTENCY
In parking-violations for the coloumn named Registration_state - one of the states has a name '99'. But the data type is defined as VAR_CHAR. So that can be considered as incomplete data / wrong data. The value for this registration_state is an integer, while the other states have a VARCHAR data type. This means that for that one particular registration_state - the data is incorrect.
